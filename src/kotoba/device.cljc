(ns kotoba.device
  "Assembled from one repo per definition.

  This namespace holds no implementation. It re-exports the definitions
  that each live in their own repo, so a call site can require one name
  and a library can require only the definitions it actually uses.

  NOT re-exported here, on purpose: IDevice. A protocol's identity is what extend-type and reify dispatch on,
  and a copy would make an implementation silently extend nothing, so the
  protocol name stays in the one repo that declares it. Requiring that repo
  is a compile error away; a copy would not be.

  Value vars are not re-exported either: denied, sensing-host-driver-refs, surface-effects. `(def x other/x)` copies, which is harmless for a function and makes
  with-redefs through this namespace a SILENT no-op for a value -- measured
  on kotoba.lang.edn, where three assertions passed against nothing at all.
  Require the repo that defines the value.
