(ns kotoba.lang.device
  "Device capability interfaces (bluetooth/wifi/display/geolocation/camera/
  motion/audio-io/ble-scan/wifi-info) as EDN + a discover protocol,
  host-injected drivers. The kotoba principle — a component touches only
  what it was granted — applies especially to hardware. device does NOT wrap
  OS APIs; it defines device surfaces as wit capability tokens and a
  discover/describe protocol, so aiueos's :aiueos/device + aiueos:host gate
  can grant/deny each surface. Consumes wit + coll. No third-party deps;
  .cljc (JVM/SCI/CLJS/GraalVM/kotoba-WASM).

  motion/audio-io/ble-scan/wifi-info were added for ADR-2607140600 Phase 3a
  (the indoor floorplan-lab's device-capability bridge). They follow the
  bluetooth/wifi/display/geolocation/camera precedent exactly: this
  namespace stays dependency-free (no `:deps` entry added for this) and
  carries no concrete driver implementation for ANY surface, old or new —
  bluetooth/wifi/display/geolocation/camera have none either, only
  `mock-device` for tests; the actual driver is always assembled by the
  caller and injected via `make-device-manager`'s `drivers` map. For these 4
  surfaces specifically, the intended host-injected driver is
  kotoba-lang/kotoba's `kotoba.sensing-host` (its `read-motion`/
  `play-audio!`/`record-audio`/`scan-ble`/`read-wifi-info` fns, registered
  as kotoba-core-contracts capability ids 234-237) — see
  `sensing-host-driver-refs` below for that wiring as pure EDN data, not a
  code dependency."
